This is a fork and improvement of the wxHTML implementation from
wxWidgets.

Its input must be something akin to XHTML (but not quite).  That is,
the code unfortunately doesn't follow any standard for HTML.

For how to use the API, please see the wxHTML documentation at the
wxWidgets site, <http://www.wxwidgets.org>.

For what (X)HTML the code accepts, please see the code.

The code is self-contained, and needs no other dependencies than
wxWidgets (2.8.X and 3.Y.Z) and its dependencies.

The code is licensed under the wxWidgets license version 3.1.

The name, wxMunkHTML, derives from the fact that it was originally
prepared for use in a project on the Danish playwright, pastor, poet,
and author, Kaj Munk.

Questions, comments, etc. about this code should be directed to me,
Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen, not to the wxWidgets team.

Enjoy!
