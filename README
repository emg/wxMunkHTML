This is a fork and improvement of the wxHTML implementation from
wxWidgets.

The code makes use a library from the Open Source project called
Emdros:

http://emdros.org

To be precise, it makes use of the libemdf.a library from that
project, and only a small subset of that library is used, namely the
qdxml.cpp file.

The code is licensed under the wxWidgets license version 3.0.

Questions, comments, etc. about this code should be directed to me,
Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen, not to the wxWidgets team.

Enjoy!
