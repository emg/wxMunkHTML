This is a fork and improvement of the wxHTML implementation from
wxWidgets.

Its input must be something akin to XHTML (but not quite).  That is,
the code unfortunately doesn't follow any standard for HTML.

The code is self-contained, and needs no other dependencies than
wxWidgets (2.8.X) and its dependencies.

The code is licensed under the wxWidgets license version 3.1.

Questions, comments, etc. about this code should be directed to me,
Ulrik Sandborg-Petersen, not to the wxWidgets team.

Enjoy!
